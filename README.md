## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [https://www.w3schools.com/][https://www.sitepoint.com/delay-sleep-pause-wait/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [My first challenge was trying to get my extra buttons to have their correct colors. I had to play around with the script.js file to make sure they
   were presented correctly. Another issue I had was trying to get the pictures inside the buttons. They were working, but not displaying correctly. It turns
   out that I had to crop the images so that they fit in a square format, and then add a rule on the style.css file to make sure they were formatted correctly.
   My last main issue was the time depletion method. I was taking away too much time so I needed to reduce the amount of time that was being decremented.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [One thing I was wondering is if it was possible to make script files with other languages, besides JavaScript. I was doing some research and I learned
   about languages such as PHP and Python being used for scripting. It also brought me to another question, which is what do different JS libraries like React
   add to the code, and what exactly does Bootstrap do?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I would spend a lot more time trying to figure out how to represent data in my script.js file inside the HTML file.]
